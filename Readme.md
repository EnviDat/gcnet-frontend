# About
As of the 1999 field season, 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) are collecting climate information on Greenland's ice sheet. Each AWS is equipped with a number of instruments to sample the following:

- air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, pressure
- accumulation rate at high temporal resolution to identify and resolve individual storms
- surface radiation balance in visible and infrared wavelengths
- sensible and latent heat flux fluxes
- snowpack conductive heat fluxes
